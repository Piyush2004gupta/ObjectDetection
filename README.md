# Object Detection Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates **Object Detection** using the **YOLOv5** model, an advanced deep learning framework for detecting and classifying objects in real-time. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is known for its speed and accuracy in object detection tasks.

The model is trained on a custom dataset and is capable of detecting various objects in images and video streams. The project also includes code for integrating **MediaPipe** for hand tracking and real-time interaction.

## Features

- **Real-time object detection** using **YOLOv5**.
- Custom dataset training to detect a range of objects.
- **Interactive controls** for fine-tuning the model.
- Integration with **MediaPipe** for hand gesture recognition and interaction.

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- YOLOv5 model repository
- OpenCV for video handling
- MediaPipe for hand tracking (optional, if you're implementing interactive controls)
